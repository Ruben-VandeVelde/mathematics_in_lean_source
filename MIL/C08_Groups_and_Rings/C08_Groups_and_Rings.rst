Groups and rings
================

We saw in :numref:`proving_identities_in_algebraic_structures` how to prove and use lemmas about
operations in groups and ring. Later in :numref:`section_algebraic_structures` we saw how
to define abstract algebraic structures, such as group structures, as well as concrete instances
such as the ring structure on Gaussian integers. Then in Chapter :numref:`hierarchies`
we saw how hierarchies of abstract structures are built.

In this chapter we will explain a lot more about groups and rings in Mathlib. We won't be able to
cover everything, especially since Mathlib constantly grows. But we will try to provide entry points
and show how essential concepts appear. There is some overlap with the discussion of Chapter
:numref:`hierarchies` but here we will emphasize how to use Mathlib instead of why Mathlib is
built that way. If anything looks strange or convoluted then the explanation is probably
in the previous chapter.
